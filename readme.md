> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The documentation included here refers to the Swift AWS Lambda Runtime v2 (code from the main branch). If you're developing for the runtime v1.x, check this [readme](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/blob/v1/readme.md) instead.

> [!WARNING]
> The Swift AWS Runtime v2 is work in progress. We will add more documentation and code examples over time.

## Pre-requisites

- Ensure you have the Swift 6.x toolchain installed.  You can [install Swift toolchains](https://www.swift.org/install/macos/) from Swift.org

- When developing on macOS, be sure you use macOS 15 (Sequoia) or a more recent macOS version.

- To build and archive your Lambda function, you need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

- To deploy the Lambda function and invoke it, you must have [an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) and [install and configure the `aws` command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

- Some examples are using [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/). Install the [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html) before deploying these examples.

## TL;DR

1. Create a new Swift executable project

```bash
mkdir MyLambda && cd MyLambda
swift package init --type executable
```

2. Prepare your `Package.swift` file

    2.1 Add the Swift AWS Lambda Runtime as a dependency

    ```bash
    swift package add-dependency https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime.git --branch main
    swift package add-target-dependency AWSLambdaRuntime MyLambda --package swift-aws-lambda-runtime
    ```

    2.2 (Optional - only on macOS) Add `platforms` after `name`

    ```
        platforms: [.macOS(.v15)],
    ```

    2.3 Your `Package.swift` file must look like this

    ```swift
    // swift-tools-version: 6.0

    import PackageDescription

    let package = Package(
        name: "MyLambda",
        platforms: [.macOS(.v15)],
        dependencies: [
            .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime.git", branch: "main"),
        ],
        targets: [
            .executableTarget(
                name: "MyLambda",
                dependencies: [
                    .product(name: "AWSLambdaRuntime", package: "swift-aws-lambda-runtime"),
                ]
                ),
        ]
    )
    ```

3. Edit `Sources/main.swift` file and replace the content with this code 

```swift
import AWSLambdaRuntime

// in this example we are receiving and responding with strings

let runtime = LambdaRuntime {
    (event: String, context: LambdaContext) in
        return String(event.reversed())
}

try await runtime.run()
```

4. Build & archive the package 

```bash
swift build
swift package archive --allow-network-connections docker
```

If there is no error, there is a ZIP file ready to deploy. 
The ZIP file is located at `.build/plugins/AWSLambdaPackager/outputs/AWSLambdaPackager/MyLambda/MyLambda.zip`

5. Deploy to AWS

There are multiple ways to deploy to AWS ([SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html), [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started), [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html), [AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html)) that are covered later in this doc.

Here is how to deploy using the `aws` command line.

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
--function-name MyLambda \
--zip-file fileb://.build/plugins/AWSLambdaPackager/outputs/AWSLambdaPackager/MyLambda/MyLambda.zip \
--runtime provided.al2 \
--handler provided  \
--architectures arm64 \
--role arn:aws:iam::<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/lambda_basic_execution
```

The `--architectures` flag is only required when you build the binary on an Apple Silicon machine (Apple M1 or more recent). It defaults to `x64`.

Be sure to replace <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID> with your actual AWS account ID (for example: 012345678901).

6. Invoke your Lambda function

```bash
aws lambda invoke \
--function-name MyLambda \
--payload $(echo \"Hello World\" | base64)  \
out.txt && cat out.txt && rm out.txt
```

This should print 

```
{
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
}
"dlroW olleH"
```

## Tutorial 

[The Swift AWS Lambda Runtime docc tutorial](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/1.0.0-alpha.3/tutorials/table-of-content) provides developers with detailed step-by-step instructions to develop, build, and deploy a Lambda function.

## Swift AWS Lambda Runtime

Many modern systems have client components like iOS, macOS or watchOS applications as well as server components that those clients interact with. Serverless functions are often the easiest and most efficient way for client application developers to extend their applications into the cloud.

Serverless functions are increasingly becoming a popular choice for running event-driven or otherwise ad-hoc compute tasks in the cloud. They power mission critical microservices and data intensive workloads. In many cases, serverless functions allow developers to more easily scale and control compute costs given their on-demand nature.

When using serverless functions, attention must be given to resource utilization as it directly impacts the costs of the system. This is where Swift shines! With its low memory footprint, deterministic performance, and quick start time, Swift is a fantastic match for the serverless functions architecture.

Combine this with Swift's developer friendliness, expressiveness, and emphasis on safety, and we have a solution that is great for developers at all skill levels, scalable, and cost effective.

Swift AWS Lambda Runtime was designed to make building Lambda functions in Swift simple and safe. The library is an implementation of the [AWS Lambda Runtime API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html) and uses an embedded asynchronous HTTP Client based on [SwiftNIO](http://github.com/apple/swift-nio) that is fine-tuned for performance in the AWS Runtime context. The library provides a multi-tier API that allows building a range of Lambda functions: From quick and simple closures to complex, performance-sensitive event handlers.

## Design Principles

The [design document](Sources/AWSLambdaRuntimeCore/Documentation.docc/Proposals/0001-v2-api.md) details the v2 API proposal for the swift-aws-lambda-runtime library, which aims to enhance the developer experience for building serverless functions in Swift.

The proposal has been reviewed and [incorporated feedback from the community](https://forums.swift.org/t/aws-lambda-v2-api-proposal/73819). The full v2 API design document is available [in this repository](Sources/AWSLambdaRuntimeCore/Documentation.docc/Proposals/0001-v2-api.md).

### Key Design Principles

The v2 API prioritizes the following principles:

- Readability and Maintainability: Extensive use of `async`/`await` improves code clarity and simplifies maintenance.

- Developer Control: Developers own the `main()` function and have the flexibility to inject dependencies into the `LambdaRuntime`. This allows you to manage service lifecycles efficiently using [Swift Service Lifecycle](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-service-lifecycle) for structured concurrency.

- Simplified Codable Support: The `LambdaCodableAdapter` struct eliminates the need for verbose boilerplate code when encoding and decoding events and responses.

### New Capabilities

The v2 API introduces two new features:

[Response Streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/]): This functionality is ideal for handling large responses that need to be sent incrementally. Â  

[Background Work](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-code-after-returning-a-response-from-an-aws-lambda-function/): Schedule tasks to run after returning a response to the AWS Lambda control plane.

These new capabilities provide greater flexibility and control when building serverless functions in Swift with the swift-aws-lambda-runtime library.

### Use Lambda Background Tasks 

Background tasks allow code to execute asynchronously after the main response has been returned, enabling additional processing without affecting response latency. This approach is ideal for scenarios like logging, data updates, or notifications that can be deferred. The code leverages Lambda's "Response Streaming" feature, which is effective for balancing real-time user responsiveness with the ability to perform extended tasks post-response. For more information about Lambda background tasks, see [this AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-code-after-returning-a-response-from-an-aws-lambda-function/).


Here is an example of a minimal function that waits 10 seconds after it returned a response but before the handler returns.
```swift
import AWSLambdaRuntime
import Foundation

struct BackgroundProcessingHandler: LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler {
    struct Input: Decodable {
        let message: String
    }

    struct Greeting: Encodable {
        let echoedMessage: String
    }

    typealias Event = Input
    typealias Output = Greeting

    func handle(
        _ event: Event,
        outputWriter: some LambdaResponseWriter<Output>,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws {
        // Return result to the Lambda control plane
        context.logger.debug("BackgroundProcessingHandler - message received")
        try await outputWriter.write(Greeting(echoedMessage: event.message))

        // Perform some background work, e.g:
        context.logger.debug("BackgroundProcessingHandler - response sent. Performing background tasks.")
        try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(10))

        // Exit the function. All asynchronous work has been executed before exiting the scope of this function.
        // Follows structured concurrency principles.
        context.logger.debug("BackgroundProcessingHandler - Background tasks completed. Returning")
        return
    }
}

let adapter = LambdaCodableAdapter(handler: BackgroundProcessingHandler())
let runtime = LambdaRuntime.init(handler: adapter)
try await runtime.run()
```

You can learn how to deploy and invoke this function in [the example README file](Examples/BackgroundTasks/README.md).
