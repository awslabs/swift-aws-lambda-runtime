/// A clock implementation based on Unix epoch time for AWS Lambda runtime operations.
///
/// `LambdaClock` provides millisecond-precision timing based on the Unix epoch
/// (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). This clock is designed for Lambda runtime
/// operations where precise wall-clock time is required.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let clock = LambdaClock()
/// let now = clock.now
/// let deadline = now.advanced(by: .seconds(30))
///
/// // Sleep until deadline
/// try await clock.sleep(until: deadline)
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance
///
/// This clock uses `clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)` on Unix systems for
/// high-precision wall-clock time measurement with millisecond resolution.
///
/// ## TimeZone Handling
///
/// The Lambda execution environment uses UTC as a timezone,
/// `LambdaClock` operates in UTC and does not account for time zones.
/// see: TZ in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html

    ///
    /// `Instant` represents a specific point in time as the number of milliseconds
    /// that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (Unix epoch).
    ///
    /// ## Thread Safety
    ///
    /// `Instant` is a value type and is inherently thread-safe.
    public struct Instant: InstantProtocol, CustomStringConvertible {

        /// - Parameter duration: The duration to add to this instant.
        /// - Returns: A new instant advanced by the specified duration.
        ///
