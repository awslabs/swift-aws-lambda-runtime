This directory contains example code for Lambda functions.

## Pre-requisites

- Ensure you have the Swift 6.x toolchain installed.  You can [install Swift toolchains](https://www.swift.org/install/macos/) from Swift.org

- When developing on macOS, be sure you use macOS 15 (Sequoia) or a more recent macOS version.

- To build and archive your Lambda functions, you need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

- To deploy your Lambda functions and invoke them, you must have [an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) and [install and configure the `aws` command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

- Some examples are using [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/). Install the [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html) before deploying these examples.

- Some examples are using the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). Install the [CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) before deploying these examples.

## AWS Credentials and Signature

This section is a short tutorial on the AWS Signature protocol and the AWS credentials.

**What is AWS SigV4?**

AWS SigV4, short for "Signature Version 4," is a protocol AWS uses to authenticate and secure requests. When you, as a developer, send a request to an AWS service, AWS SigV4 makes sure the request is verified and hasn’t been tampered with. This is done through a digital signature, which is created by combining your request details with your secret AWS credentials. This signature tells AWS that the request is genuine and is coming from a user who has the right permissions.

**How to Obtain AWS Access Keys and Session Tokens**

To start making authenticated requests with AWS SigV4, you’ll need three main pieces of information:

1. **Access Key ID**: This is a unique identifier for your AWS account, IAM (Identity and Access Management) user, or federated user.

2. **Secret Access Key**: This is a secret code that only you and AWS know. It works together with your access key ID to sign requests.

3. **Session Token (Optional)**: If you're using temporary security credentials, AWS will also provide a session token. This is usually required if you're using temporary access (e.g., through AWS STS, which provides short-lived, temporary credentials, or for federated users).

To obtain these keys, you need an AWS account:

1. **Sign up or Log in to AWS Console**: Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), log in, or create an AWS account if you don’t have one.

2. **Create IAM User**: In the console, go to IAM (Identity and Access Management) and create a new user. Ensure you set permissions that match what the user will need for your application (e.g., permissions to access specific AWS services, such as AWS Lambda).

3. **Generate Access Key and Secret Access Key**: In the IAM user credentials section, find the option to generate an "Access Key" and "Secret Access Key." Save these securely! You’ll need them to authenticate your requests.

4. **(Optional) Generate Temporary Security Credentials**: If you’re using temporary credentials (which are more secure for short-term access), use AWS Security Token Service (STS). You can call the `GetSessionToken` or `AssumeRole` API to generate temporary credentials, including a session token.

With these in hand, you can use AWS SigV4 to securely sign your requests and interact with AWS services from your Swift app.

## ⚠️ Security and Reliability Notice

These are example applications for demonstration purposes. When deploying such infrastructure in production environments, we strongly encourage you to follow these best practices for improved security and resiliency:

- Enable access logging on API Gateway ([documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-logging.html))
- Ensure that AWS Lambda function is configured for function-level concurrent execution limit ([concurrency documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-concurrency.html), [configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html))
- Check encryption settings for Lambda environment variables ([documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars-encryption.html))
- Ensure that AWS Lambda function is configured for a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) ([documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async-retain-records.html#invocation-dlq))
- Ensure that AWS Lambda function is configured inside a VPC when it needs to access private resources ([documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html), [code example](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/tree/main/Examples/ServiceLifecycle%2BPostgres))
