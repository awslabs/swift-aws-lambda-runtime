# API Gateway and Cloud Development Kit

This is a simple example of an AWS Lambda function invoked through an Amazon API Gateway and deployed with the Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

## Code 

The Lambda function takes all HTTP headers it receives as input and returns them as output. See the [API Gateway example](Examples/APIGateway/README.md) for a complete description of the code.

## Build & Package 

To build the package, type the following commands.

```bash
swift build
swift package archive --allow-network-connections docker
```

If there is no error, there is a ZIP file ready to deploy. 
The ZIP file is located at `.build/plugins/AWSLambdaPackager/outputs/AWSLambdaPackager/APIGatewayLambda/APIGatewayLambda.zip`

## Deploy

>[NOTE]
>Before deploying the infrastructure, you need to have NodeJS and the AWS CDK installed and configured.
>For more information, see the [AWS CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html).

To deploy the infrastructure, type the following commands.

```sh
# Change to the infra directory
cd infra

# Install the dependencies (only before the first deployment)
npm install 

cdk deploy

 ✅  LambdaApiStack

✨  Deployment time: 42.96s

Outputs:
LambdaApiStack.ApiUrl = https://tyqnjcawh0.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/
Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-central-1:401955065246:stack/LambdaApiStack/e0054390-be05-11ef-9504-065628de4b89

✨  Total time: 45.84s
```

## Invoke your Lambda function

To invoke the Lambda function, use this `curl` command line.

```bash
curl https://tyqnjcawh0.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
```

Be sure to replace the URL with the API Gateway endpoint returned in the previous step.

This should print a JSON similar to 

```bash 
{"version":"2.0","rawPath":"\/","isBase64Encoded":false,"rawQueryString":"","headers":{"user-agent":"curl\/8.7.1","accept":"*\/*","host":"a5q74es3k2.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com","content-length":"0","x-amzn-trace-id":"Root=1-66fb0388-691f744d4bd3c99c7436a78d","x-forwarded-port":"443","x-forwarded-for":"81.0.0.43","x-forwarded-proto":"https"},"requestContext":{"requestId":"e719cgNpoAMEcwA=","http":{"sourceIp":"81.0.0.43","path":"\/","protocol":"HTTP\/1.1","userAgent":"curl\/8.7.1","method":"GET"},"stage":"$default","apiId":"a5q74es3k2","time":"30\/Sep\/2024:20:01:12 +0000","timeEpoch":1727726472922,"domainPrefix":"a5q74es3k2","domainName":"a5q74es3k2.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com","accountId":"012345678901"}
```

If you have `jq` installed, you can use it to pretty print the output.

```bash
curl -s  https://tyqnjcawh0.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com | jq

  },

}
```

## Undeploy

When done testing, you can delete the infrastructure with this command.

```bash
cdk destroy
